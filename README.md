### hey there

A few years ago I discovered that my vocation is networking and programming, I enjoy a lot learning about computer science and I want to continue studying while searching for a job.

I understand that this field of studies means constant self-learning and I belive that this is one of my best virtues.
Computer Science and Information Tecnologies are a very big world that I truly would like to keep on discovering :)
